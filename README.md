## contributing

Contributions are encouraged! If you're new or unsure about anything check out our [issues tracker](https://github.com/napari/docs/issues) or reach out on [zulip](https://napari.zulipchat.com/) before jumping in.
It's nice to be able preview how your contribution will look on the web, so here we provide a brief summary of what's required for a local setup that will allow you to do so.
Alternatively, our CI setup provides a preview link that shows your changes.
Please read our [contributing guide](https://napari.org/dev/developers/contributing/documentation/index.html) for more comprehensive information about contributing documentation.

### quickstart: local setup
* __Check the prerequisites__
    1. Create a clean Python (>=3.10) environment (e.g., with conda).
    1. In that environment, create an editable `napari` installation with the `docs` dependency group and a Qt backend. For example, after first forking and cloning the main `napari` project if you've not previously done so, run `python -m pip install -e ".[pyqt, docs]"` from your `napari/napari` clone directory. This will use the default Qt backend.
    1. Fork *this* repository, `napari/docs`, and then clone your fork to your local machine. NB: you may want to name your fork e.g. `napari-docs` rather than just `docs`.
* __Build__ locally
    * If you're building on Windows, a few extra steps are required; you can follow [this guide](https://napari.org/dev/developers/contributing/documentation/index.html#building-the-documentation-on-windows).
    * From the root of your local clone of this repository, run one of these:
        * `make html`, for a full build, including the example gallery
        * `make html-noplot`, for a full build without building the example gallery
        * `make slimfast`, for a *fast, parallel* build of only sources in the `docs` repository, with no notebook cell outputs and no example gallery.  
  
        Note: `-live` variants of these are available to auto-build when edited files are saved, e.g. `slimfast-live`. For more options, see [the documentation](https://napari.org/dev/developers/contributing/documentation/index.html#building-what-you-need).
* __Preview__ locally, either dragging-and-dropping `docs/_build/index.html` into a browser, or deploying a local server with `python3 -m http.server --directory docs/_build`.

These steps should set you up to build and preview your docs contributions on your local machine.
