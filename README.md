## contributing

Contributions are encouraged! Given that we're in an early stage, you may want to reach out on our [Github Issues](https://github.com/napari/docs/issues) before jumping in.
It's nice to be able preview how your contribution will look on the web, so here we provide a brief summary of what's required for a local setup that will allow you to do so.
Please read our [contributing guide](https://napari.org/dev/developers/contributing/documentation/index.html) for more comprehensive information about contributing documentation.

### quickstart: local setup
* __Check the prerequisites__
    1. Create a [development installation](https://napari.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#dev-installation) of `napari` on your local machine.
    1. Fork this repository, and then clone your fork to your local machine. 
NB: the name will be `napari-docs` rather than simply `docs`.
    1. Create a clean Python environment (e.g., with conda), and with your local clone's root folder as the working directory, install the docs requirements with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* __Build__ locally
    * If you're building on Windows, a few extra steps are required; you can follow [this guide](https://napari.org/stable/developers/documentation/index.html#building-the-documentation-on-windows).
    * From the root of your local clone of this repository, run one of these:
        * `make docs`, if your changes include the example gallery
        * `make docs-install && make html-noplot`, otherwise
* __Preview__ locally, either dragging-and-dropping `docs/_build/index.html` into a browser, or deploying a local server with `python3 -m http.server --directory docs/_build`.
