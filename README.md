## contributing

Contributions are encouraged! If you're new or unsure about anything check out our [issues tracker](https://github.com/napari/docs/issues) or reach out on [zulip](https://napari.zulipchat.com/) before jumping in.
It's nice to be able preview how your contribution will look on the web, so here we provide a brief summary of what's required for a local setup that will allow you to do so.
Alternatively, our CI setup provides a preview link that shows your changes.
Please read our [contributing guide](https://napari.org/dev/developers/contributing/documentation/index.html) for more comprehensive information about contributing documentation.

### quickstart: local setup
* __Check the prerequisites__
    1. Create a clean Python environment (e.g., with conda).
    1. In that environment, create a [development installation](https://napari.org/dev/developers/contributing/dev_install.html#dev-installation) of `napari` on your local machine, first forking and cloning the main `napari` project if you've not previously done so.
    1. Fork this repository, and then clone your fork to your local machine. NB: you may want to name your fork e.g. `napari-docs` rather than just `docs`.
    1. With your local clone's root folder as the working directory, and with the environment created in the first step activated, install the docs requirements with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* __Build__ locally
    * If you're building on Windows, a few extra steps are required; you can follow [this guide](https://napari.org/stable/developers/documentation/index.html#building-the-documentation-on-windows).
    * From the root of your local clone of this repository, run one of these:
        * `make docs`, if your changes include the example gallery
        * `make docs-install && make html-noplot`, otherwise
* __Preview__ locally, either dragging-and-dropping `docs/_build/index.html` into a browser, or deploying a local server with `python3 -m http.server --directory docs/_build`.

These steps should set you up to build and preview your docs contributions on your local machine.
