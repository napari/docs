<!-- This will appear in the announcement banner at the top of the site.
It needs to be activated by passing the link:
"https://napari.org/dev/_static/announcement.html",
in the html_theme_options section of conf.py using the key:
"announcement"

This file MUST live in the _static directory to allow for dynamic updates
without a full site rebuild.
