napari.run() - Start the Event Loop
-----------------------------------

The `napari` module provides a function `run` to start the user interface's event loop.
Currently, napari's user interface uses the Qt library.
See the :ref:`event loop guide <intro-to-event-loop>` for an explanation of the event loop's purpose and operation.
