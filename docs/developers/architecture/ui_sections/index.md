# UI sections

Here you can find some diagrams and information related with the different
sections that conform the application graphical interface. You will find for each section a diagram describing
the dependencies between modules and a directory tree showing where those modules are located.

- [Application menu](./application_menus_ui)
- [Application status bar](./application_status_bar_ui)
- [Layers controls](./layers_controls_ui)
- [Layers list](./layers_list_ui)
- [Viewer](./viewer_ui)
- [Console](./console_ui)
- [Dialogs](./dialogs_ui)

Also, a plugin to inspect how specific UI elements/widgets are defined
over the napari source code is available: [napari-ui-tracer](https://github.com/dalthviz/napari-ui-tracer)
