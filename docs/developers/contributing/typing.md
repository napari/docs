# Type checking

napari is type-checked with [pyrefly](https://pyrefly.org). The check runs on every
pull request and has to pass before we merge, but **you are not expected to fix type
errors in your own PR**. If it fails and the fix isn't obvious, ask for help
and a team member will be eager to guide you.

```{note}
Why we moved off mypy, and what we compared against, is in the Island Dispatch post
[*From Any to Certainty*](https://napari.org/island-dispatch/blog/from-any-to-certainty.html).
```

## Running the check

```sh
tox -e pyrefly
```

This builds a small environment from `resources/requirements_pyrefly.txt`
constraints with tox. A run takes about a second with a cached environment.

`tox -e pyrefly` defaults to `pyrefly check`, and arguments after `--`
are appended, so any pyrefly subcommand can also work:

```sh
tox -e pyrefly -- check --count-errors
tox -e pyrefly -- suppress --remove-unused=all
```

Don't run pyrefly from your development environment (e.g. `uv run pyrefly check`):
it resolves the packages you happen to have installed rather than the pinned ones,
and reports a different set of errors. In addition,
the [code editor integration](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/) reads the same
`[tool.pyrefly]` configuration, but it sees your environment too — so treat editor
suggestions as a hint and `tox -e pyrefly` as the standard.

## Annotating new code

1. **Annotate the parameters and return values** you are adding or changing, and leave
   unrelated types alone — a bug fix shouldn't turn into a typing sweep. Only
   modify previous annotations if they are relevant to the contribution you are making.
2. When feasible, **add `from __future__ import annotations`** at the top of any module that doesn't
   have it yet. This makes annotations lazy, so they are not evaluated at runtime,
   in order to infer the types:
3. **Import annotation-only types under `if TYPE_CHECKING:`**, so heavy imports and
   potential import cycles stay out of the runtime path. Ruff rules flag these and
   will often move them for you with pre-commit. To do this, add
   `from typing import TYPE_CHECKING` to the top of the file, then wrap the imports in:
   ```python
   if TYPE_CHECKING:
       from some_module import SomeType
   ```
4. **Run `tox -e pyrefly`** and read the first complaint before the rest; later errors
   are often consequences of the first one.
5. **If something can't be fixed honestly**, suppress it by error kind and say why, as
   described below.

## Choosing types

- **Annotate parameters and return values, not local variables.** They are the contract other
  modules rely on, and locals are inferred well enough without help. 
- **Parameters should accept the widest type that works; returns give back the concrete
  type you built.** When psosible, take `Iterable`, `Sequence` or `Mapping` rather than `list`,
  and hand back the `list` you actually made.
- **`Any` switches off checking for everything it touches.** It is sometimes the
  honest answer for a dynamic corner of the code, but it should be a decision rather
  than a way to make one error disappear.
- **Prefer narrowing to `cast()`.**
  [`typing.cast`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.cast) only
  tells the checker to believe you, so if it is the only option left, keep it as
  narrow as you can and say in a comment what makes it safe.
- **Type arrays only with what the contract needs.** The full annotation for a
  NumPy array is `np.ndarray`, for example
  `np.ndarray[tuple[int, ...], np.dtype[np.float64]]`,
  which pins both the shape and the dtype. If the shape is not part of the
  contract, use `numpy.typing`'s `npt.NDArray` alias instead,
  which leaves the shape unspecified but the dtype specified, for example
  `npt.NDArray[np.float64]`. If neither shape nor dtype is part of the contract,
  use `np.ndarray` without any arguments. For docstrings, always use the runtime
  class name `np.ndarray` even where the annotation is `npt.NDArray`.
  Read more in the [NumPy typing guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/typing.html),
  including about `npt.ArrayLike` for inputs that can be converted to arrays.

## When the check complains

Suppressing should be rare. Most types can be written honestly, and a suppression in
the wrong place hides a real bug. Occasionally one genuinely will not resolve,
because of a third-party stub, a gap in the typing specification, or dynamic
behaviour — that is what suppressions are for. The important thing is to **name the
error kind**, so a reader can tell why it was needed and pyrefly can check that the
suppression is still doing something.
The last word of a pyrefly message is the rule it applied:

```
ERROR src/napari/utils/tree/node.py:64:31-53: Argument `int | None` is not assignable
to parameter `object` with type `int` in function `list.insert` [bad-argument-type]
                                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Put that rule on the offending line:

```python
indices.insert(0, item.index_in_parent())  # pyrefly: ignore[bad-argument-type]
```

A bare `# pyrefly: ignore` silences every diagnostic on the line, including ones a
future pyrefly release adds, and nothing can check it for staleness.

The pyrefly config sets `unused-ignore` as an error, so a suppression that stops
matching anything fails the build. To clear the ones your change left behind, run
`tox -e pyrefly -- suppress --remove-unused=all`.

## Modifying the type checking config

- **Don't widen `project-excludes` to make a failure go away.** Adding a module takes
  it out of the check for everyone. Suppress narrowly instead, and if you believe a
  module really can't be checked, raise it in the pull request rather than adding it
  quietly.
- **Bringing a module back into the check** is a self-contained task and a good first
  contribution: delete its entry from `project-excludes` in `pyproject.toml`, run
  `tox -e pyrefly`, fix what you can, suppress what you cannot with codes, then run it
  again and drop any suppression the change leaves unused. For example, `utils` are
  friendlier starting points than the Qt widget code.

## What the check does not cover

The environment is deliberately small — it installs `resources/requirements_pyrefly.txt`
and nothing else — so imports like `vispy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `dask`, `zarr` and their
kind resolve to `Any`. `project-excludes` also takes many files under
`src/napari` out of the check, tests included, such that zero errors means
only that pyrefly found nothing wrong with the type it could see.

## Where things live

| What | Where |

| Checker config | `[tool.pyrefly]` in `pyproject.toml` |
| Pinned checker version and its dependencies | `resources/requirements_pyrefly.in` (source) and `resources/requirements_pyrefly.txt` (lock) |

| Tox environment | `[testenv:pyrefly]` in `tox.ini` |
