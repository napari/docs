# Axis names in napari

```{warning}
The napari team is actively working to improve the consistency and user
experience of axis names and other axis metadata. This guide should be up to
date, but things may be in a confusing state. It's not you, it's us! In
summary:

- **Before 0.6.0,** napari's `Viewer.dims` held axis names, and these were
  mapped to layer axes purely based on order. Layer axes did not have names.
- **In 0.6.x,**, layers gained the ability to hold axis names and axis units,
  which was important for [reader plugins](contributions-readers) to be able
  to provide this information. However, napari did not use that information for
  anything: it was up to the user to propagate it to `Viewer.dims`.
- **In 0.7.x,** layer axis *units* propagate to `Viewer.dims` automatically,
  but layer names are still ignored by default.
- [**In the hopefully near future,**](active-roadmap), layer axis names will be
  automatically combined to provide the viewer axis names, which will be the
  union of all layer axes.
```

napari started out as a tool to look at NumPy arrays. As such, it mimics some
behavior when mixing arrays of different dimensions, known as
[broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html).

Specifically, arrays of mixed dimensionality are *right-aligned*. In order to
make array shapes match across different elements of napari, napari 0.7.0
started using *negative indexing*, i.e. indexing from the right end of a list
or tuple, for its axes labels.

Suppose we have a time lapse of neuronal activity, with a 3D image with
dimensions T, Y, and X, a set of 2D masks of dimensions Y, X, and a set of
2D centroid coordinates, with dimensions Y, X. Before napari 0.7.0, the default
axis labels would have been:

| component  |  T |  Y |  X |
|------------|----|----|----|
| viewer     |  0 |  1 |  2 |
| image      |  0 |  1 |  2 |
| masks      |    |  0 |  1 |
| centroids  |    |  0 |  1 |

The mismatch between the *layer* axes and the *viewer* axes can result in
confusing UI and subtle bugs.

Using negative indexing, as in napari 0.7.0+, the default axes line up with
the display and NumPy behavior:

| component  |  T |  Y |  X |
|------------|----|----|----|
| viewer     | -3 | -2 | -1 |
| image      | -3 | -2 | -1 |
| masks      |    | -2 | -1 |
| centroids  |    | -2 | -1 |

Of course, as a user, you can set the axis names for the viewer by
[right-clicking on the roll-dimensions button](gui-axis-renaming), and for the
layers by setting `layer.axis_labels` or by using the
[napari-metadata](https://github.com/napari/napari-metadata) plugin.
