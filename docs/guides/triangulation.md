# Triangulation backends for the napari Shapes layer

## Background

In order to draw polygons and polygon edges to the screen, napari first needs
to break these shapes up into triangles, a fundamental graphical element
understood by graphics frameworks like OpenGL. This process is called
*triangulation*.

In the beginning, napari directly used a simple triangulation implementation
provided by Vispy. Two issues with the Vispy implementation were that it was
slow, and that it could not account for complicated shapes like polygons with
holes in them.

[figure: polygon, then triangulation using Vispy, triangle, bermuda]

The issue of speed was partly resolved in napari x.y.z when Martin Weigert
added the option to use *triangle*, a triangulation library written in C.
However, triangle provided no error checking of input data, and some datasets
could crash napari altogether. Also, triangle is distributed under a custom,
non-standard license, which means that we are not allowed to distribute it
with napari, and notably not in the bundled application.

Starting in napari x.y.z, funded by a grant to the SpatialData project by CZI,
PhD student Grzegorz Bokota started making dramatic improvements to napari's
triangulation capabilities, first by reducing array allocations and
implementing key operations in numba-accelerated functions, then by simplifying
triangulation of simple shapes like circles and ellipses, and finally by
creating custom triangulation libraries in C++ (PartSegCore-compiled-backend)
and Rust (bermuda). For complex shapes, these speedups added up to a 200-fold
acceleration, all while improving robustness to malformed data. (blog1, blog2)

## Usage

So how do you take advantage of these speedups?

0. Install the backend you would like to use. By default, napari uses the pure
   Python backend, but you can also install [numba](https://numba.pydata.org)
   (which will also accelerate the Labels layer, incidentally),
   [triangle](https://pypi.org/project/triangle/),
   [PartSegCore-compiled-backend](https://pypi.org/project/PartSegCore-compiled-backend/),
   or [bermuda](https://pypi.org/project/bermuda/).
1. Open napari's settings panel, then click on Experimental on the left hand
   navigation, and look for Triangulation backend.
2. Select "Fastest available" and napari will use the fastest installed
   backend. Otherwise, select a specific backend. napari will fall back on the
   Pure Python implementation if the backend is not installed. You might want
   to try different backends if a specific one is having issues with your
   data. If you do encounter issues, please let us know at
   https://github.com/napari/napari/issues.
