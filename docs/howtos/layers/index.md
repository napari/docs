[Layers](napari.layers) are the viewable objects that can be added to a viewer.
To learn about how to use the layers currently supported by napari, check the

Each of these guides has a section on how to manipulate the layers using the GUI
controls and a section on how to manipulate them programmatically.

For a high-level overview of the napari Layers, see
