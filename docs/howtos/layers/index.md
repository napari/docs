# Layers guide

[Layers](napari.layers) are the viewable objects that can be added to a viewer,
and are the primary way that napari represents and interacts with data. Each
layer type is designed to handle a specific type of data, such as images,
points, shapes, and more.

To learn about how to use the layers currently supported by napari, check the
following how-to guides:

```{tableofcontents}
```

Each of these guides has a section on how to manipulate the layers using the GUI
controls and a section on how to manipulate them programmatically.

For a high-level overview of the napari Layers, see
[](layers-glance).
