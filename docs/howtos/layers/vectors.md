# Using the `vectors` layer

In this document, you will learn about the `napari` `vectors` layer, including
how to display many vectors simultaneously and adjust their properties.

For more information about layers, refer to [Layers at a glance](../../guides/layers).

```{note}
Vector layers can be added only programmatically, i.e., in the console, or using
a script, not from the GUI. Please refer to
[A simple example](#a-simple-example) and use the code there to add a vectors
layer first, then explore the GUI controls.
```

## When to use the `vectors` layer

The `vectors` layer allows you to display many vectors with defined starting
points and directions. It is particularly useful for people who want to
visualize large vector fields, for example if you are doing polarization
microscopy. You can adjust the color, width, and length of all the vectors from
the console or from the GUI.

## A simple example

You can create a new viewer and add vectors in one go using the
{meth}`napari.view_vectors` method, or if you already have an existing viewer,
you can add vectors to it using `viewer.add_vectors`. The API of both methods is
the same. In these examples we'll mainly use `add_vectors` to overlay vectors
onto an existing image.

In this example, we will overlay vectors on the image of a photographer:

```{code-cell} python
import napari
import numpy as np
from skimage import data

# create vector data
n = 250
vectors = np.zeros((n, 2, 2), dtype=np.float32)
phi_space = np.linspace(0, 4 * np.pi, n)
radius_space = np.linspace(0, 100, n)
# assign x-y projection
vectors[:, 1, 0] = radius_space * np.cos(phi_space)
vectors[:, 1, 1] = radius_space * np.sin(phi_space)
# assign x-y position
vectors[:, 0] = vectors[:, 1] + 256

# add the image
viewer = napari.view_image(data.camera(), name='photographer')
# add the vectors
vectors_layer = viewer.add_vectors(vectors, edge_width=3)
```

```{code-cell} python
:tags: [hide-input]

from napari.utils import nbscreenshot

nbscreenshot(viewer, alt_text="Vectors overlaid on an image")
```

```{code-cell} python
:tags: [remove-cell]

viewer.close()
```

## Using the GUI to manipulate vectors

Before you can use the GUI to manipulate vectors, you must load a vector layer.
Please refer to [A simple example](#a-simple-example) to add a `vectors` layer
first, then explore the editing options the GUI provides.

* Opacity - click and hold the circle on the opacity slider bar and adjust it to
  any value between 0.00 (clear) and 1.00 (completely opaque).
* Width - adjusting the width makes the vectors appear thicker or thinner. Use
  the + and - buttons on either side of the width bar to adjust width or click
  on the number in the middle of the bar and enter a value. The minimum value is
  0.10.
* Length - adjusting the length makes the vector longer or shorter. Use the +
  and - buttons on either side of the length bar to adjust length or click on
  the number in the middle of the bar and enter a value. The minimum value is
  0.10.
* Blending - `blending` has the options of `opaque`, `translucent`,
  `translucent no depth`, `minimum`, or `additive` in the dropdown. Refer to the
  [Blending layers](blending-layers) section of _Layers at a glance_ for an
  explanation of each type of blending.
* Edge color mode - select `direct`, `cycle`, or `colormap` from the dropdown.
  * Direct (default mode) allows each vector to be set arbitrarily.
  * Cycle allows the color to be set via a color cycle over an attribute.
  * Colormap allows the color to be set via a color map over an attribute.
* Edge color - click the thumbnail next to `edge color:` to select or create a
  color from the pallette.
* Out of slice - if this box is checked, `out of slice` is on or true. If this
  box is not checked, `out of slice` is off or false. If it is on or true,
  vectors slightly out of slice are rendered.

### Vector starting position  

The starting position of vectors cannot be edited from the GUI. Nor is it
possible to draw vectors from the GUI. If you want to draw lines using the GUI
you should use the `Lines` shape inside a `shapes` layer.

### 3D rendering

All layers can be rendered in both 2D and 3D. One of the viewer buttons at the
bottom of the left panel can toggle between these 2 modes.
When in 2D, the button looks like this: ![image: 2D/3D button](../../images/3D-button.png), ready to switch to 3D mode.
When in 3D, the button looks like this: ![image: 2D/3D button](../../images/2D-button.png), ready to switch to 2D mode.

The number of dimensions sliders will be 2 or 3 less than the total number of
dimensions of the layer, allowing you to browse volumetric timeseries data and
other high dimensional data. See [](../../gallery/nD_vectors) to see shapes in
both 2D and 3D:

<figure>
  <video width="100%" controls autoplay loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="../../_static/images/nD_vectors.webm" type="video/webm" />
    <source src="../../_static/images/nD_vectors.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

      title="Your browser does not support the video tag"
      alt="3D rendering of a vectors layer over an image."
    >
  </video>
</figure>
```

## Arguments of `view_vectors` and `add_vectors`

{meth}`~napari.view_layers.view_vectors` and {meth}`~napari.Viewer.add_vectors`
accept the same layer-creation parameters.

```{code-cell} python
:tags: [hide-output]

help(napari.view_vectors)
```

### Changing vector length, width, and color

Scale the length of all the vectors on a layer using the `layer.length` property.

Set the width of all the vectors in a layer using the `layer.width` property.

Set the color of all the vectors in a layer using the `layer.edge_color` property.

Pan and zoom are not available on the vectors layer.

## Vectors data

The input data to the `vectors` layer must be an `Nx2xD` NumPy array
representing `N` vectors with start position and projection values in `D`
dimensions, or it must be an `N1xN2 ... xNDxD` array where each of the first
`D` dimensions corresponds to the voxel of the location of the vector, and the
last dimension contains the `D` values of the projection of that vector. The
former representation is useful when you have vectors that can start in
arbitrary positions in the canvas. The latter representation is useful when your
vectors are defined on a grid, say corresponding to the voxels of an image, and
you have one vector per grid.

Here is an example from [](../../gallery/add_vectors_image) of a grid of vectors
defined over a random image:

![image: add vectors overlaid on an image](../../images/add_vectors_image.png)

Regardless of how the data is passed, we convert it to the `Nx2xD`
representation internally. This representation is accessible through the
`layer.data` property.
