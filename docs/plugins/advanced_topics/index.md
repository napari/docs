```{warning} Changes to Plugins in napari 0.6.0
In napari 0.6.0 we have made some changes to napari's default behaviour when validating legacy "npe1" plugins.
You may see a warning when starting `napari` if you have legacy "npe1" plugins installed.
You can learn more about this change in the [Changes to the plugin engine in 0.6.0](adapted-plugin-guide) document.
```

Some plugin developers may find more **in-depth, technical information** helpful. This section describes topics, such as:
- specifications for napari's plugin ecosystem using the plugin engine `npe2`.
- migration to `npe2` from the deprecated napari plugin engine v1.
