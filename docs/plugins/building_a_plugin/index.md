```{admonition} Introducing npe2
:class: important

We introduced a new plugin engine [`npe2`][npe2] in December 2021.

Unless otherwise stated, most of the documentation herein pertains
to the new npe2 format (which uses a static `napari.yaml` manifest)

Plugins targeting the first generation `napari-plugin-engine` 
(using `@napari_hook_implementation` decorators, see [npe1]) will
continue to work for at least the first half of 2022, but we
recommend migrating to `npe2`. See the
[migration guide](npe2-migration-guide) for details.
