# Getting started

Plugins allow you to extend napari with new functionality. Plugins can be used to:

- Load or write new file formats [readers] and [writers]
- Perform analyses with customised user interfaces [widgets]
- Load sample data [sample_data]
- Change the look of napari with a color [theme]

If you are looking to **use** published plugins, see the
[guide on installing plugins](find-and-install-plugins), or head to the [napari hub][napari_hub] to
search for plugins.
