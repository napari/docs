# Finding and installing plugins

napari plugins are Python packages distributed on the Python Package Index
(PyPI), and annotated with the tag [`Framework ::
napari`](https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Framework+%3A%3A+napari).  The
[napari hub](https://napari-hub.org) uses this data, together with additional
metadata, to produce a more user friendly way to find napari plugins.

Similarly, plugins annotated on PyPI with `Framework :: napari` are listed in
the `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Plugins` menu within napari.

## Installing plugins with napari

All PyPI packages annotated with the `Framework :: napari` tag can be installed
directly from within napari:
Firstly, from the “Plugins” menu, select “Install/Uninstall Plugins...”.
Then, in the plugin installer menu that opens, you can either:

1. Install plugins from the list: you can scroll through the list of “Available Plugins”, or
   filter plugins using the text box at the top of the dialog. From the list,
   you can then install a plugin by clicking the `install` button in the
   tile of the plugin you want to install. You can also uninstall or update
   plugins from this dialog in a similar way under the “Installed Plugins” section.

2. Install plugins via manual input: where it says “Install by name/URL”,
    enter the name of the plugin you want to install (or *any* valid pip
    [requirement
    specifier](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirement-specifiers/)
    or [VCS scheme](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support)). Then click
    the “Install” button next to the input bar. This method allows for more flexibility
    in the plugins you can install, but it is also a bit more advanced.

   ```{admonition} Example
   If you want to install `napari-svg` directly from the development branch on the [github repository](https://github.com/napari/napari-svg), enter `git+https://github.com/napari/napari-svg.git` in the text field.
   ```
