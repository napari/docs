# Refactor custom theme to pydata theme plus config

## Motivation

- Maintaining a separate theme adds more burden.
- Adding more complexity than needed.
- Frustrating to contribute since builds aren't clear to do locally.

## Done

- added logging to scripts
- fixed code copy

## TODO

- reduce warnings (no warnings when make no plot)
- ~~add scripts from nap theme here maybe~~
- pygments highlighting
- headless on mac
- fix styling for This Page source
- search wtf keyboard shortcut (where did you go)
