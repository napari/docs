# Refactor custom theme to pydata theme plus config

## Motivation

- Maintaining a separate theme adds more burden.
- Adding more complexity than needed.
- Frustrating to contribute since builds aren't clear to do locally.

## Done

- added logging to scripts

## TODO

- reduce warnings
- add scripts from nap theme here maybe
- pygments highlighting
