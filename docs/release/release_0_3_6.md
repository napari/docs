# napari 0.3.6

We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.3.6!
napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based
rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).


For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:

## Highlights
This release contains the long awaited addition of text to both the points and
shapes layers ({pr}`1374`). Checkout our `examples/*_with_text.py` for simple usage
and this [segmentation annotation tutorial](https://napari.org/tutorials/segmentation/annotate_segmentation)
for a more real-world use case.

We've added support for a circular paintbrush for easier labels painting,
and moved more of our contrast limits and gamma setting to the GPU for faster
rendering and interactivity with 3D rendered datasets. As always this release
contains various bug fixes and other improvements, including some automated
reformatting and fixes to our docstrings.

This release also contains a number of contributions from new authors thanks
to the SciPy conference sprints. Weâ€™re delighted to welcome new contributors to
the codebase. If you want help contributing to napari, reach out to us on our chat
room at https://napari.zulipchat.com!
