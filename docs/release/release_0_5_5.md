# napari 0.5.5

*Thu, Dec 12, 2024*

Weâ€™re happy to announce the release of napari 0.5.5! (You might have noticed it's been a hot minute since our last release â€” the team has been busy on the conference circuit (watch [our talk at PyConAU](https://youtu.be/EYmTLGwScBI?si=5SUqxVYuhyAmlD6H)!), defending their PhDs, and more! We are now back to our regularly-scheduled programming. ðŸ˜‚

napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. Itâ€™s designed for exploring, annotating, and analyzing multi-dimensional images. Itâ€™s built on Qt (for the GUI), VisPy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, and friends).

For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website: https://napari.org/

## Highlights

This release continues the 0.5 tradition of churning out the bug fixes and
enhancements, with 24 pull requests total in that category. If you are a user
of oblique plane rendering, you'll appreciate
[#7422](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7422), which fixes the plane
calculation when data is anisotropic.

And, did you have a hole in your heart where high-quality 3D labels rendering
should have been? Check out
[#7431](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7431), in which [Ashley
Anderson](https://github.com/aganders3) has (again) improved the quality of 3D
labels by filling the (apparent, but fictional) holes in labels at the borders
of a volume. Before/after gif:

Additionally, [Grzegorz Bokota](https://github.com/Czaki) has again sped up
launch time for Shapes layers by porting all the edge triangulation code to
numba ([#7268](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7268)). As part of that
work he also created a fantastic developer example explaining how the edge
triangulation works, which you can find at
[examples/dev/triangle_edge.py](https://github.com/napari/napari/blob/b2edccd6e40e04467ccfeec0257c2160783f7187/examples/dev/triangle_edge.py).
Give it a read and a play if you want to peek under the hood of the Shapes
layer!

Did you miss a napari error or warning while reading these notes? We don't
blame you! Those missed notifications will be a thing of the past with
[#7220](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7220), which will keep
notifications open if the napari window is not in focus. Whew!

Finally, for the zarrventurous among you, napari 0.5.5 is ready for zarr v3,
coming soon to a PyPI near you!
([#7215](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7215)) If you are using or
testing the zarr 3.0.0 betas, try them with napari! We hope you'll be
pleasantly surprised. ðŸ˜Š

As always, we thank all the contributors to this napari release and all the
previous ones! We welcome [Carol Willing](https://github.com/willingc) and
[Tim Monko](https://github.com/TimMonko) to the list of contributors. Read on
for all the changes in this version!
