# napari 0.6.4
⚠️ *Note: these release notes are still in draft while 0.6.4 is in release candidate testing.* ⚠️

*Tue, Aug 12, 2025*

We’re happy to announce the release of napari 0.6.4!

napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It’s designed for exploring, annotating, and analyzing multi-dimensional images. It’s built on Qt (for the GUI), VisPy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, and friends).

For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website: https://napari.org/

## Highlights

### Run scripts with napari from the command line

As a follow-up to the ability to drag-n-drop scripts into the napari window from 0.6.3, you can now run scripts directly from the command line using the `napari` command and the path to the script ([#8185](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8185) and [#8187](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8187)). For example `napari examples/magic_immage_arithmetic.py` will open napari and run the local script.


## Improvements

- Remove old path handle in napari start ([#8185](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8185))
- Prevent `napari.run` from being executed when running scripts from napari ([#8187](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8187))
