We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.6.6!
napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based
rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).

For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website,
https://napari.org.

napari follows [EffVer (Intended Effort Versioning)](https://effver.org/); this is a **Meso** release containing awesome new features, but some effort may be needed when updating previous projects to use this version.

## Highlights

This a small bugfix release, following up the changes in 0.6.5.

### Zooming in the dark?
In the previous release we accidentally made the [zoom tool added in v0.6.3](https://napari.org/stable/release/release_0_6_3.html#a-zoom-with-a-view) invisible. Whoops! No worries, it's back üîç.

### "Open with napari"

When using the [napari bundle](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation_bundle_conda.html#how-to-install-the-napari-app), it will now detect when a file can be opened with napari based on the extension. This allows you to use the `open with >` menu from your operative system to open files with napari!

PS: Since we did quite a few changes behind the scenes on this new version of the bundle, you might experience some issues. Don't hesitate to open an issue or contact us on zulip if you do!
