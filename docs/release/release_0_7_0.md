# napari 0.7.0
⚠️ *Note: these release notes are still in draft while 0.7.0 is in release candidate testing.* ⚠️

*Tue, Jan 27, 2026*

We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.7.0!
napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based
rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).

For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website,
https://napari.org.

napari follows [EffVer (Intended Effort Versioning)](https://effver.org/); this is a **Macro** release containing awesome new features, but may require dedication of some significant time when upgrading projects to use this version.

## Highlights

More detail coming soon...

### Transition to npe2 plugin engine 🔌

In 0.6.0 we began the process of deprecating npe1 (napari-plugin-engine).
In all 0.6.x releases, npe1 plugins were automatically converted to npe2 by default,
and users could turn off the `use_npe2_adaptor` setting to continue using npe1 plugins
without auto-conversion.

In 0.7.0 this setting is being removed, and plugins will *only* continue to function if
they can be auto-converted to npe2. Most plugins will be unaffected, but those that rely
on import-time behaviour may not work as expected. If a plugin is relying on import-time
behaviour, it may be able to replicate this using the new startup scripts functionality added
in 0.6.5 ([#8188](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8188)).

If you encounter conversion issues in a plugin you rely on, please contact the
plugin authors to encourage them to migrate their plugin to the npe2 system.

This change has been a long time coming, and it's allowed us to remove thousands
of lines of tangled and confusing legacy code. Now that we have, it's unleashed
the potential for massive improvements to file opening and saving in `napari`,
and exciting new features for our plugin infrastructure. Stay tuned!

For more details on this change and how it affects plugins, see the [detailed
guide](adapted-plugin-guide). If you are a plugin author and your plugin is not
yet npe2-compatible, please see our [npe2 migration
guide](npe2-migration-guide), and, if you encounter any issues, get in touch in
our [Plugins Zulip chat
channel](https://napari.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/309872-plugins) or by
coming to one of our [community meetings](meeting-schedule).

### Grid overlay - bigger, better, faster 📈

If you've been playing with our new grid overlays since 0.6.5, you 
may have stumbled into performance issues when progressively adding
new layers to the viewer. Stumble no longer! Our grid overlays are now wicked fast and buttery smooth 🧈.

We've also fixed some issues with mouse interactions and deleting
layers, so you can tile to your heart's content. Try it out:

```py
import napari

viewer = napari.Viewer()

# enable grid with stride 2 to get layers split two-by-two
viewer.grid.enabled = True
viewer.grid.stride = 2

# set the scale bar to gridded mode so it appears in each grid box
viewer.scale_bar.visible = True
viewer.scale_bar.gridded = True

layers = viewer.open_sample('napari', 'lily')

# enable color bars
for layer in layers:
    layer.colorbar.visible = True
```

### What's in an angle? The truth! Fixed camera angles 🎥

If you've ever set up the camera to take that perfect publication-worthy photo of 
your data (and taken the time to query the camera angles), you may have noticed they seemed... off.
That's because they were! Very... off. This was due to a long-standing bug in how we calculated our
camera angles, fueled in part by some arcane vispy axis-swapping tomfoolery, and in part by napari's
starting position of `viewer.camera.angles = (0, 0, 90)`.

Good news! With [#8281](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8281), angles make sense again. The default camera angles are `(0, 0, 0)`, and they
move intuitively -- so `viewer.camera.angles = (0, 0, 10)` actually represents a 10 degree
rotation around the 0th dimension. What a time to be alive!

Old versions of napari:

![Image showing an old version of a napari viewer with a layer opened and its camera angle (10, 0, 0) displayed in the console.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ae2040c-36f7-4c4c-8ef8-140202d7ccda)

New and sane:

![Image showing the 0.7.0 napari viewer with a layer opened and its camera angle (10, 0, 0) displayed in the console. The layer is rotated 10 degrees in its first dimension](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b972b46-5c3c-439a-8b0a-fe8a293224e5)

All rotations are now right-handed (counterclockwise when the axis points towards the viewer),
with automatic sign-flipping for flipped camera views. We've also removed the unwieldy to type
(and confusing to reason about) `quaternion2euler_degrees` in favour of scipy's `Rotation` class.

Now for the bad news... After many (and we do [mean](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8537)
[**many**](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8557)) attempts, we realized we couldn't
provide legacy conversion functions to get you to and from the original camera angles. Therefore,
this is a **breaking change**.

If you had scripts or notebooks setting up angles for screenshots, or if you've got workshop
materials or tutorials with preset angles, they'll need to be updated. Any existing code
using `viewer.camera.angles = (z, y, x)` will now produce a different view than before.
