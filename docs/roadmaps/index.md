# Roadmaps

The [**napari global roadmap**](active_roadmap.md) is a living document, and we revisit it every three months. It contains a summary of our vision, our mission and values, and our key focus areas
for the project. It also details strategic deliverables and key priorities for each focus area within a horizon of 3-5 years.

## For contributors

If a particular roadmap item is important to you and you want to help make it happen sooner, please [chat with us](https://napari.zulipchat.com/)! You can help by [contributing code or documentation](https://napari.org/dev/developers/index.html)
